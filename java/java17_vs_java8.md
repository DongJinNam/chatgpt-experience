# Diffrences between java 17 and java 8

### Question

Question : show me the differences between java 17 and java 8 with example codes and pros and cons

### Answer
Certainly! Here are some key differences between Java 17 and Java 8, along with example code snippets and pros and cons of each version:

Java 8 (Released on March 2014):
1. Lambdas and Functional Programming:
   - Example:
     ```java
     List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
     numbers.forEach(n -> System.out.println(n));
     ```
   - Pros: Enables concise and functional programming style, enhances code readability, and facilitates parallel programming.
   - Cons: Requires a paradigm shift for developers accustomed to traditional Java programming.

2. Stream API:
   - Example:
     ```java
     List<String> names = Arrays.asList("John", "Jane", "Adam", "Eva");
     long count = names.stream()
                      .filter(name -> name.startsWith("J"))
                      .count();
     ```
   - Pros: Provides a fluent and expressive way to perform operations on collections, improves code readability, and supports parallel processing.
   - Cons: May introduce a performance overhead for small data sets and complex pipelines.

3. Optional Class:
   - Example:
     ```java
     Optional<String> name = Optional.ofNullable(getNameFromDatabase());
     String displayName = name.orElse("Default");
     ```
   - Pros: Helps avoid null pointer exceptions, encourages better error handling, and improves code quality.
   - Cons: May lead to excessive usage and overuse of Optional, causing increased complexity.

Java 17 (Released on September 2021):
1. Pattern Matching for Switch:
   - Example:
     ```java
     String day = "Monday";
     int numLetters = switch (day) {
         case "Monday" -> 6;
         case "Tuesday" -> 7;
         default -> throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid day");
     };
     ```
   - Pros: Simplifies switch statements by eliminating repetitive code, enhances readability, and reduces chances of bugs.
   - Cons: Requires developers to be familiar with the new syntax and may not be widely adopted immediately.

2. Sealed Classes:
   - Example:
     ```java
     sealed interface Shape permits Circle, Rectangle, Triangle {
         // Common methods
     }
     final class Circle implements Shape { /* Circle implementation */ }
     final class Rectangle implements Shape { /* Rectangle implementation */ }
     final class Triangle implements Shape { /* Triangle implementation */ }
     ```
   - Pros: Enables better control over class inheritance, enhances encapsulation, and improves code maintainability and robustness.
   - Cons: Requires upfront design decisions and understanding of sealed classes and their restrictions.

3. Enhanced Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNG):
   - Example:
     ```java
     RandomGenerator generator = new RandomGenerator();
     int randomNumber = generator.nextInt(100);
     ```
   - Pros: Provides improved and more secure random number generation algorithms, enhancing security-related applications.
   - Cons: Typically not a significant factor unless working on specific use cases that require strong random number generation.

Pros and Cons of Java 8:
Pros:
- Introduction of lambdas and functional programming.
- Stream API for efficient data processing.
- Optional class for better error handling.

Cons:
- Steeper learning curve for developers accustomed to traditional Java.
- Potential performance overhead with Stream API for small data sets.
- Potential overuse of Optional leading to increased complexity.

Pros and Cons of Java 17:
Pros:
- Pattern matching for switch simplifies code and reduces bugs.
- Sealed classes provide better control over class inheritance.
- Enhanced PRNG improves security-related applications.

Cons:
- Learning curve for new syntax and features.
- Sealed classes require upfront design decisions.
- Enhanced PRNG may not significantly impact all applications.
