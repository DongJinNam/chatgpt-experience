# Mysql 8.0 vs Mysql 5.7

Developers should be aware of several key differences between MySQL 8.0 and MySQL 5.7 versions. Here are some important aspects to consider:

1. Performance and Scalability:
   - MySQL 8.0 introduced significant improvements in performance and scalability compared to MySQL 5.7.
   - InnoDB, the default storage engine, has enhanced multi-threading capabilities, leading to better concurrency and higher throughput.
   - MySQL 8.0 introduced the concept of Instant Durable Durability, improving the durability of committed transactions without compromising performance.
   - Improved query optimizer and execution plan handling in MySQL 8.0 can result in better query performance.

2. JSON Support:
   - MySQL 8.0 provides expanded JSON support with JSON functions, enabling efficient manipulation and querying of JSON data within the database.
   - JSON validation, aggregation, and indexing capabilities were added in MySQL 8.0, offering more flexibility in handling JSON data.

3. Roles and Password Management:
   - MySQL 8.0 introduced a native support for roles, allowing developers to define and manage sets of privileges at a higher level of abstraction.
   - Password management policies were enhanced in MySQL 8.0, providing improved security options and mechanisms.

4. Window Functions and Analytical Queries:
   - MySQL 8.0 introduced support for window functions, enabling advanced analytical queries such as ranking, partitioning, and aggregation over specific data sets.
   - Window functions provide enhanced capabilities for data analysis and reporting.

5. Improved Unicode Support:
   - MySQL 8.0 added better support for Unicode with the introduction of the utf8mb4_0900_bin collation, which supports the full Unicode 9.0 character set, including supplementary characters.

6. Atomic DDL Statements:
   - In MySQL 8.0, certain Data Definition Language (DDL) statements, such as CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, and DROP TABLE, became atomic operations. This means that concurrent DDL statements do not block each other, improving concurrency and reducing downtime during schema changes.

7. InnoDB Cluster and Group Replication:
   - MySQL 8.0 introduced native support for InnoDB Cluster, providing an integrated solution for high availability and automated failover.
   - Group Replication was introduced in MySQL 5.7 and enhanced in MySQL 8.0, allowing developers to create fault-tolerant replication groups with automatic distributed recovery.

These are just a few highlights of the differences between MySQL 8.0 and MySQL 5.7 versions. It's important for developers to consult the official MySQL documentation and release notes for each version to gain a comprehensive understanding of the specific changes, new features, and improvements introduced in each version.
