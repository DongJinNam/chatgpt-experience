# Test Driven Development

**Summary of "Test-Driven Development: By Example" by Kent Beck:**

"Test-Driven Development: By Example" introduces the core concepts of Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology. It emphasizes the iterative approach of writing a failing test, making it pass, and then refactoring for clean and optimized code. It teaches developers how to think through their feature before writing it, which improves the design, quality, and reliability of the software.

**Things a Software Developer Needs to Know about Test-Driven Development with Java:**

1. **Understand the TDD Cycle**: TDD cycle involves three steps, often referred to as "Red, Green, Refactor."

   - **Red**: Write a failing test
   - **Green**: Write enough code to make the test pass
   - **Refactor**: Optimize the code, ensuring all tests still pass

2. **Write the Test Before the Code**: In TDD, the test is written before the actual code. This means thinking about the feature's requirements and behavior before implementing it.

3. **Each Test Should Validate a Single Feature or Functionality**: Don't try to test multiple functionalities with one test. Keep it focused on one thing.

4. **Keep Tests Small and Fast**: Tests should be fast to execute, as a slow test suite can hinder development speed. 

5. **Don't Ignore Failing Tests**: Failing tests indicate a problem with the code. Never ignore a failing test. It should be fixed immediately.

6. **Refactor Regularly**: After making a test pass, look at your code for possible refactoring to make it cleaner and more efficient.

Here is an example of a TDD approach in Java using JUnit:

```java
// The Test

import org.junit.Test;
import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;

public class CalculatorTest {
    @Test
    public void testSum() {
        Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
        int sum = calculator.sum(2, 3);
        assertEquals(5, sum);
    }
}

// The Implementation

public class Calculator {
    public int sum(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

In this example, the test was written first (`testSum`), asserting that the sum of 2 and 3 should be 5. Only after this test was written was the `Calculator` class implemented. This class contains a `sum` method that makes the test pass. 

Compared to a non-TDD approach, the TDD approach may initially seem slower because you're writing tests first. But in the long run, it results in higher quality code, fewer bugs, and makes adding new features or changing existing ones much safer and faster because you'll know almost immediately if you broke anything.
